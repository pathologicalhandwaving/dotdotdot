*** Settings

**** gc-cons-threshold

Increasing gc-cons-threshold to a ridiculously high number during initialization.
Threshold increase will decrease load and compile time.
After initialization has completed we want to lower the threshold to avoid long GC pauses during use.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(eval-and-compile
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 402653184
        gc-cons-percentage 0.6))
#+END_SRC


**** Disable some byte compiler warnings to reduce noise

Change this if you want to see some or all byte compiler warnings

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq bytes-compile-warnings '(not free-vars unresolved noruntime lexical make-local))
