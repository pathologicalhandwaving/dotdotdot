 - Anchoring (focalism) :: The tendency to rely too heavily, or 'anchor,' on one trait or piece of information when making decisions.

  - Availability Cascade :: A self-reinforcing process in which a collective belief gains more and more plausibility through its increasing repetition in public discourse (or 'repeat something long enough and it will become true').

  - Attentional Bias :: The tendency of our perception to be affected by our recurring thoughts.

  - Availability Heuristic :: The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater 'availability' in memory, which can be influenced by how recent the memories are or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be.

  - Backfire Effect :: When people react to disconfirming evidence by strengthening their beliefs.


  - Bandwagon Effect :: The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Related to groupthink and herd behavior.
