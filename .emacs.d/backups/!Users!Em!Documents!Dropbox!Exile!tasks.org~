And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry, and the cold
We're the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm
In the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you've known
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
So open your eyes, child
Let's be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We'll sing through the day
Of the lives that we've lost
And the lives we've reclaimed
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help)
No! No! No!
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!

 Author states that when a living thing dies it loses its system-ness.

 I disagree, things that are dead are also components of systems they are host to a whole new conglomeration of microbes, cairns, and other organisms which feed on the remains. 
 The dead thing is still a part of its system, it is that now it plays a different role.

Timing is everything. When it comes to wit the time you spend processing your thoughts may be a missed opportunity.

2. Say whatever comes to your mind.  We often self-monitor and are careful about the things that come out of our mouth.  While there are certain contexts where it isn’t appropriate to let just any old thing roll from your tongue, using your judgment, practice letting your guard down a little.  Forget the self-monitoring and say whatever unpolished thing comes to your mind.

Wit is about delivering the unexpected.

3. Don’t be invested in the outcome. Let your goal be to just be yourself.  You don’t even have to aim to be funny. Most people that are funny are just funny. In fact, they may even seem nonchalant about whatever it is they’re saying.

Wit doesn’t try hard.

4. Engage in Banter. Wit is best when it is like a tennis ball hit from one side of the court to the other. Granted, there are some people unskilled at being quick in thought and confident enough to return the quip, but if you can find “in’s” in the conversation to tease a little, this may open the door for the other to be engaged and comfortable enough to go back and forth with you a little.

People love to feel like you’re paying attention to them and building on the things they say with humor will go a long way to making them feel things for you. 

5. Know a little something. Let’s face it. Witty people are also most likely intelligent people.  They use metaphors and other antics that help in their delivery, but in order to use metaphors you have to be an observer of life and know how to make connections to seemingly unconnected concepts.

 Polish your wit with a little knowledge of popular culture, words of a song or a good book.

6. Keep your ears open for opportunities to weave in earlier jokes.

Think about your favorite stand up routine. The trick of the trade is being able to tell a story while using a common thread that unites all of what you’re saying.

The popularity of the phrase, “That’s what she said,” from televisions, The Office, was not only funny because it most often came at unawares, but also because it built on earlier jokes making laugher roll that much easier.

7. End on a high note. There’s nothing less sexy than someone who’s trying to be funny, but just doesn’t know when to end.  You laugh the first time, the second, maybe even the third, but ALRIGHT, ENOUGH, it’s not funny anymore! Please, I beg, don’t be that girl! Allow enough space in time between uses of earlier jokes.

Be like a comedian. Hypothetically drop the mike and end the show while everyone’s still laughing.


*** CLIP Adopt a lighthearted frame of mind — at least temporarily. It’s difficult to be witty when you’re stressed. Give yourself permission to speak up or react “in the moment.” If you amuse, great. If not, play it straight. Simply move ahead in the conversation as if you meant the line to be straightforward. Nothing lost.

*** CLIP Get physical. Body language can be as witty as spoken language. A wry smile at just the right spot. A raised eyebrow. Shrugged shoulders and a flip of the wrist. Such physical humor pumped into a conversation at an unsuspecting moment can generate the same laugh as the wittiest remark.

*** CLIP In Hamlet, just before Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude that the prince is insane, he makes the now famous statement, “brevity is the soul of wit.” In a lot of ways, the best wit is very much like ripping off a Band-Aid: swift and snappy. Keep a joke going for too long or extend the pun into a rambling metaphor, and the witty remark loses its punch

*** CLIP Plan for spontaneity. As Mark Twain once observed: “It usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech.” Professional speakers call them “saver” lines — funny remarks to “save the day” when common things go awry like technology failures, memory lapses, or audience disruptions. For example, when delivering a speech, a colleague of mine actually fell off the stage and landed sprawling on the floor in front of her audience. Her saver line: “I’ll now take questions from the floor.” Likewise, if you typically find yourself in the same situations repeatedly, develop some reusable lines that will seem spontaneous to those around you.

*** CLIP Say it before you overthink it. Otherwise, your moment will pass. It’s much like the problem I have getting on a fast-moving escalator. If I’m in a hurry and approach a fast, steep escalator, I step on it without a problem. But if I stop dead-still at the top of that escalator, it seems much harder to step on. I often stand there letting one stair, then the second stair, then the third stair pass by, thinking I’ll catch the next one, or the next one, or maybe the next one. Momentum, once stopped, seems difficult to regain. So it is with conversation. Once you hesitate with quick wit, it melts in your mouth. The moment passes. Lost forever.

In fields where nothing grew but weeds 
I found a flower at my feet 
Bending there in my direction 
I wrapped a hand around its stem 
I pulled until the roots gave in 
Finding now what I've been missing 
And I know
So I tell myself 
I tell myself it's wrong 
There's a point we've passed in which we cant return 
I've felt the cold rain of the coming storm
All because of you 
I haven't slept in so long 
When I do, I dream 
Of drowning in the ocean 
Longing for the shore 
Where I can lay my head down 
I'll follow your voice 
All you have to do 
Is shout it out
Inside my hands these pedals bound 
Dried up, fallen to the ground 
But it was already too late now 
I pushed my fingers through the earth 
Returned this flower to the dirt 
So it could live; I walked away now
But I know 
Not a day goes by when I don't feel it's wrong 
There's a point we've passed in which we can't return 
I've felt the cold rain of the coming storm
All because of you 
All because of you 
All because of you 
I haven't slept in so long 
When I do, I dream 
Of drowning in the ocean 
Longing for the shore 
Where I can lay my head down 
Inside these arms of yours 
All because of you 
I believe in angels 
Not the kind with wings 
No, not the kind with halos 
The kind that bring you home 
When home becomes a strange place 
I'll follow your voice 
All you have to do 
Is shout it out

Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry, and the cold
We're the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm
In the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you've known
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
So open your eyes, child
Let's be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We'll sing through the day
Of the lives that we've lost
And the lives we've reclaimed
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help)
No! No! No!
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!

Acetic acid, but you need to take the job outside: it is very smelly. Acetic acid, being volatile, will clean all surfaces, not just those under the liquid. Citric acid is better if there is any rust.

* CLIP Granny Weatherwax was often angry.  She considered it one of her strong points.  Genuine anger is one of the world’s great creative forces.  But you had to learn how to control it.  That didn’t mean you let it trickle away.  It meant you dammed it, carefully, let it develop a working head, let it drown whole valleys of the mind and then, just when the whole structure was about to collapse, opened a tiny pipeline at the base and let the iron-hard steam of wrath power the turbines of revenge.  (WS)

Thank you for enrolling in my free newsletter. Each month, I discuss recent updates about Internet Search (OSINT), Digital Privacy, and Online Security. There is something new for everyone in this month's edition.
Make Your Amazon Account More Secure & Private

I am not sure how I would get by without Amazon today. I generally make a purchase at least once a week, and all of my shipments go to a secure Amazon Locker in whatever town I happen to be in. This convenience can quickly turn into a privacy nightmare if you allow specific information to remain public. I encourage all Amazon customers to make the following three changes to their account(s).

1) Remove your Amazon public profile

Your Amazon profile is created automatically, whether you want it or not, and it contains comments, ratings, public Wish Lists, biographical information, and other site interaction. This profile doesn’t include your purchases or your browsing history, but it’s very informative. If you want to control what activity is visible on your public profile, do the following:

Put your cursor on the “Account & Lists,” button and then click on “Your Account”

Scroll down to the “Ordering and shopping preferences” section. Click the “Profile” link above the social media preferences link

Click on the link in the orange box to the right that says, “Edit your profile”

Click the “Edit privacy settings” tab

Select “Hide all activity on your profile”

If your profile is showing your real name, or other biographical information you don’t want, go back to the profile settings page and click the Edit profile tab. You can edit or delete any information like your Bio, Occupation, Location, and more. You can even change the “public name” on your profile and post reviews anonymously.

2) Make your lists private

There are two main “lists” on Amazon; the Shopping List, and the Wish List. Many people use their Wish Lists for gift ideas, but we often use Wish Lists as a log of items we don’t want to forget. The trouble is, anyone in the world can find your Wish List by searching your name. To check the privacy settings of your Amazon Lists, do the following:

Click on the “Accounts & Lists” drop-down box then select “Shopping List” or “Wish List”

On this “Your Lists” page, click on three dots (next to “Share List”) then select “Manage List”

Change your list details like your list name, the name of the recipient, email, and birthday

Change the list’s privacy by clicking on it and selecting “Private” on the drop-down box

3) Stop Amazon from tracking your browsing

Amazon tracks all your browsing activity by default. The company saves your searches, including items you recently viewed and product categories you browsed. All of this information helps Amazon create targeted ads. Although your browsing history is hidden from the public, you may find this habit unsettling. To stop Amazon from tracking your browsing activity, do the following:

On the upper menu, click on “Your Browsing History”

On the next page, click on the “Manage history” drop-down arrow

Toggle “Turn Browsing History on/off” to Off

Clear your entire browsing history here by clicking the “Remove all items” button

Return to “Your Account” page

Under “Email alerts, messages, and ads,” click “Advertising preferences”

On this page, select “Do Not Personalize Ads from Amazon for this Internet Browser”

Hit “Submit”
Amazon is an amazingly convenient purchasing option. Like most merchants, they want your private data in order to sell you more product. These simple steps give you a bit more control of how they use your details. This list does not cover privacy considerations when using an Amazon Alexa, but my gut says that anyone concerned with privacy from Amazon would not possess a listening device such as the Alexa inside their home.

Firefox Tool: Download Star

Prior to Firefox version 57, I relied heavily on the DownThemAll extension for bulk downloads of files, images, or embedded data. This extension is no longer supported, and will not work within fully updated versions of Firefox. While I could switch to Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release), that is only a temporary bandage to the problem. Instead, I now use Download Star for bulk downloads, which is available here:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-star/

This extension adds a small white icon in the upper right of Firefox. Clicking it executes a new window with numerous options. I will begin with a quick demo of my own home page. The following image displays my selection of “Images” and the default download folder on my Mac of ~/user/Downloads/images. This can be modified to any folder you desire. The “12” indicates that all twelve images on this page will be downloaded, and you can toggle off any images you want to skip. Once you see the desired files for download, click the small down arrow next to the “12” in the upper right. This will download all of these images.



In another scenario, I conducted a search of “OSINT” intitle:index.of in order to find an open directory containing files titled OSINT. This led me to https://cyberwar.nl/d/ which contains hundreds of PDF, PNG, and other file types. In the image below, you can see that I deselected the embedded images button (lower left), selected the links option (lower left), and selected the Document filter (upper middle). This immediately notified me that 559 documents are ready for download. In the image, you can see a “greyed” jpg that will not be downloaded, but green pdf files which will be retrieved. I could have selected all filters in order to download everything from this page.



You can also filter by terms. In my investigations, this tools allows immediate download of hundreds of files at once. I have used it for open directories of videos, documents, and audio files. It could also be used to download images from large social media profiles. Overall, this tool is a vital companion to the embedded Firefox Screen Capture Tool.

Firefox Tool: Screen Capture

During my Live and Online OSINT Training Courses, I stress the importance of documentation during an online investigation. Over the years, I have demonstrated free screen capture tools such as Fireshot and Nimbus, and premium (much better) options such as Hunchly. While Hunchly is my preferred overall evidence capture tool, it currently only works in Chrome, which I try to avoid for privacy reasons. I prefer Firefox for all investigations and personal use due to the better privacy control and availability of their Containers Extension. Recent updates to Firefox introduced a native screen capture tool, which has been flawless for my investigations.

Directly to the right of the address bar in Firefox is three horizontal dots. Clicking this reveals a menu with an option to “Take a Screenshot”. Selecting this option activates the screen capture utility allowing you to select a single portion of the page, the entire page, or the visible portion of the page. In the image below, I have hovered over the title portion of this blog post with the full options visible to the right.



In almost every investigation, I simply choose the “Save Full Page” option and archive the result. The quality is good, but not superb. The result is a png graphic file, and I would prefer a pdf. However, the free tool gets the job done without installing additional extensions. Since I try to keep my Firefox add-ons to a minimum, I am using the feature much more heavily than Fireshot. However, I do not receive some of the Fireshot benefits such as custom file naming and archive type (pdf). Fireshot has had its own limitations, especially when capturing large Facebook and Twitter pages. The built-in Firefox screen capture has handled large social media pages with ease. I have yet to find a dynamic page that it could not capture.

The Firefox screen caprture tool is embedded into every updated Firefox install. I encourage readers to test and be antiquated with the options. My rule for online investigations is “If you do not document your findings, they never existed”.

Enable Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) in Firefox

During my Cyber Keynotes, I heavily preach the need for two-factor authentication (2FA), preferably with a Yubikey device. I have even been known to carry a few sealed units as giveaways when someone shows interest. This small USB device is required in order to access any of my accounts that support it. A username and password is not enough. This technology is the primary reason that Google has not had any of their employee’s accounts phished since 2017 (LINK). Until recently, the Chrome browser was required in order to use Yubikeys with some services, especially Google, Facebook, and Dropbox. While Firefox cannot log into a Yubikey protected Google account by default, we can make a small modification in order to allow it to function. The following steps will activate Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) within Firefox.

In the address bar, enter about:config

Agree to any warnings

In the search field, type security.webauth.u2f

Double click the entry to change to “True”

You can now navigate to GMail and other U2F optional services and use your Yubikey as you would in Chrome.

Online Training Video Updates

Members of my Online Video Training Courses receive video and software updates every month. The updates for this month are now live and include the following.

OSINT: Documentation Techniques: This month, we are excited to bring you 3 new guest posts from Jon Engstrom. Jon has been teaching our live OSINT courses, and presents a unique perspective from his investigations. This first video explicitly demonstrates Jon's documentation techniques during his OSINT investigations. This video replaces an outdated documentation video that demonstrated tools which are no longer updated. In this video, you will learn techniques for documenting and archiving your online investigations.

OSINT: Criminal Markets I: This video is the first of a two part series about online criminal marketplaces. In this video, you will learn investigation techniques associated with web forums related to criminal activity. These forums possess a unique challenge in that the majority of the participants remain as anonymous as possible. Jon will demonstrate techniques for uncovering true identities of the criminals that hide behind these "anonymous" marketplaces.

OSINT: Criminal Markets II: This video is the second and final segment of the criminal markets instruction. Jon continues to demonstrate his investigation techniques into the criminals that hide behind anonymous connections in order to commit their crimes online. These two videos cover numerous facets of criminal markets, including credit card forums, database leak forums, and drug marketplaces.
