#+CAPTION: Loneliness
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, 
  but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, 
  or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  What the government is,
  if it be not a tyranny,
  which the men of our choice have conferred on our President,
  and the President of our choice has assented to,
  & accepted over the friendly strangers,
  to whom the mild spirit of our country,
  & it’s laws had pledged hospitality & protection:
  that the men of our choice have more respected choice
  bare suspicions of the President,
  than the solid rights of innocence,
  the claims of justification,
  the sacred force of truth,
  & the forms and substance of law & justice:
  in questions of power then,
  let no more be heard of confidence in man,
  but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution.

#+CAPTION: Edward Snowden mirroring Thomas Jefferson
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  While I pray that public awareness and debate will lead to reform,
  bear in mind that the policies of men change in time,
  and even the Constitution is subverted
  when the appetites of power demand it.

  In words from history:
  Let us speak no more of faith in man,
  but bind him down from mischief by the chains of cryptography.

  Saying that you don’t care about the right to privacy
  because you have nothing to hide,
  is no different than saying you don’t care about freedom of speech
  because you have nothing to say.
  It’s a deeply anti-social principle
  because rights are not just individual,
  they’re collective,
  and what may not have value to you today
  may have value to an entire population,
  an entire people,
  an entire way of life tomorrow.
  And if you don’t stand up for it,
  then who will?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When we've got these people who have practically limitless powers
  within a society,
  if they get a pass without so much as a slap on the wrist,
  what example does that set for the next group of officials
  that come into power?
  To push the lines a little bit further,
  a little bit further,
  a little bit further,
  and we'll realize that we're no longer citizens -
  we're subjects.
