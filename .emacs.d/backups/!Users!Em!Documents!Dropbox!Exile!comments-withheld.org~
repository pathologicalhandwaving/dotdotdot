  - Blissfully child free
  - Living my own life instead of bitterly and vicariously hating it through my carelessly gotten offspring
  - Blessedly unmarried or hampered by a partner
  - with a disposable income that belongs only to me
  - Not addicted to my television
  - Able to hold my liquor
  - Not needlessly bothered by imagined insults
  - Capable of beautiful mathematics
  
In other words, not these poor, miserable, bastards.

** COMMENT I think baseball parents as I have known them at the hotel exemplify priviledge more precisely than any other personal experience I have had. Where others would be convicted of child neglect or reckless endangerment, baseball parents believe themselves entitled. Where others would be prosecuted for drunken disorderly conduct, baseball parents see entitlement. Where others would be criticized as bad parents, baseball parents are entitled. In any area where you would expect maturity, baseball parents act like sociopaths.

* COMMENT They sit there day after day, night after night, giving everything to a box, letting it live for them, think for them; it takes everything from them and they absently offer more. It over stimulates them, leaving them bored, empty, bitter lives that can never measure up to the carefully choreographed world it shows them.

They waste away, and we are left behind wondering if they were ever there.
What could we remember of them when they are gone? Two shells in front of a television is the strongest memory we have.
A memory of lives wasted, of time they chose to spend dreaming of lives that never existed, instead of with us.
