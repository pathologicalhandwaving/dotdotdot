** COMMENT It's times like this, when I'm confronted with beligerently drunk, ethically challenged, baseball parents that I feel a bit smug remembering who I am:

  - Blissfully child free
  - Living my own life instead of bitterly and vicariously hating it through my carelessly gotten offspring
  - Blessedly unmarried or hampered by a partner
  - with a disposable income that belongs only to me
  - Not addicted to my television
  - Able to hold my liquor
  - Not needlessly bothered by imagined insults
  - Capable of beautiful mathematics
  
In other words, not these poor, miserable, bastards.

** COMMENT The customer is hardly ever right. In particular, the customer will be the most wrong they have ever been when they fail to remember they are not the only customer and that they must not infringe on the rights or ability of other customers to use the same service.

** COMMENT I think baseball parents as I have known them at the hotel exemplify priviledge more precisely than any other personal experience I have had. Where others would be convicted of child neglect or reckless endangerment, baseball parents believe themselves entitled. Where others would be prosecuted for drunken disorderly conduct, baseball parents see entitlement. Where others would be criticized as bad parents, baseball parents are entitled. In any area where you would expect maturity, baseball parents act like sociopaths.
