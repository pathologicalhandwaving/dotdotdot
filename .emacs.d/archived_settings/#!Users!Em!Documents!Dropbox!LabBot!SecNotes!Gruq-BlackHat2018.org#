** Domains
   - Land (1D)

       - Dislocation - Overwhelm, Better Tech (rare), Better Position
       - Balance
         - Maneuverable warfare
   - Sea (2D)
     - Advantage/Disadvantage:
       - Location tactics (crossing the T)
         - Tactics
           - Crossing the T
             - Only successfully accomplished twice in history

      - Dislocation
        - Location based, above and behind
      - Confrontation - Dogfights
      - Theory
        - Create highly maneuverable planes to allow skilled pilots to best less skilled pilots (jousting in the air)
        - Praxis
          - Show up with more planes, above and behind the target, and ambush
          - Skill is not the advantage numbers are
          - Theory was wrong, advantage not due to individual skill, that would be fighting fair. Fighting fairly is a gamble.
          - Praxis Revealed
            - Advantage came from the usual factors of location and overwhelming force
    - Space (4D)
    - Cyber (5D)
      - Adds another actual positional dimension
      - Advantage/Disadvantage:
        - Adds the dimension of inside
          - You can be inside your adversary observing and changing what they do
          - Dimensions are interesting in the way that they intersect
