Hello,  Next Tuesday (January 19) I will have a meeting to talk about the potential research problems for this semester (I will give a short about 5-10 minute pitch on each of four problems) and then we can pick problems, put ourselves into groups, and make plans for the semester.  I am optimistic that we can make some progress on some of these problems.  I will also plan to have pizza for us, so if you have a preferred type of pizza, please let me know.  If for some reason you cannot make it to the meeting, please let me know (and preferably find a time to talk with me on Tuesday if you still want to keep working on a problem).  Best regards.  Steve
