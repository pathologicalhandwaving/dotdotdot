NAME
    install - Dummy module that prevents unexpected results from the CPAN
    shell

DESCRIPTION
    Many people at one time or another mistakenly ask the CPAN shell to
    install the 'install' module:

        $ cpan install Foo

    Unlike lots of package managers, the CPAN shell doesn't use commands
    like 'install' so this tries to install the 'install' module as well as
    the 'Foo' module.

    This 'install' module does absolutely nothing except install and has no
    prerequisites so nothing bad will happen when this mistake is made.
