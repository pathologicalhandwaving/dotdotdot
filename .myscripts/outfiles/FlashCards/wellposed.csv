posed	Well-posed	If a problem is well-formulated then it is well-posed.
posed	condition1	A problem is well-posed if it exists.
posed	condition2	A problem is well-posed if its solution is unique.
posed	condition3	A problem is well-posed if it varies continuously with the perturbation of the data
posed	ill-posed	A problem is ill-posed if it fails any of the three conditions for being well-posed
posed	soluble 	An ill-posed problem may still be soluble
posed	ill-conditioned 	A problem is ill-conditioned if a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the solution.
posed	ill-conditioned but well-posed 	Even if a problem is well-posed, it may still be ill-conditioned.
posed	condition number	The condition number of a function with respect to an argument measures how much the output may change for small changes in the input.
posed	condition number measures?	The condition number measures how sensitive a function is to changes or error in the input, and how much error in the output results from an error in the input.
posed	large condition number	If the condition number is large then the problem is ill-conditioned
posed	small condition number	If the condition number is small then the problem is well-conditioned
posed	zero condition number	If at any point the function is zero then the condition number at that point is infinite and there is infinite relative change at the point.
posed	solution if well-posed	If the problem is well-posed there is a good chance a solution can be found using a stable algorithm
posed	stable 	If a problem is well-posed the output should in some sense be continuous as a function of the perturbation (changes in the data)
posed	not well-posed problem solutions 	If a problem is not well-posed it must be reformulated in order for a numerical treatment to be used.
posed	re-formulation 	Re-formulation of a problem is often accomplised by including or re-evaluating assumptions, such as including the smoothness of a solution.
posed	regularization of ill-posed problems	Regularization of ill-posed problems informally is the reformulation of the problem to make it amenable to numerical solution.
posed	regularization	The process of introducing additional information in order to solve ill-posed problems and to prevent overfitting.
