marlin	Hash Proof Systems	Method of building efficient chosen-ciphertext-secure IND-CCA encryption schemes
marlin	Security notion for PKC systems	Security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack
marlin	KDF constructions	combining cryptographic primitives together within a model which takes into account all their known properties to prevent attacks by whatever means an attacker may conceptually come up with
marlin	Difficult aspect KDF constructions	Unlike most crypto constructions speed of implementation in the device the system is used in is critical to the security of the system
marlin	KDF	Key Derivation Function
marlin	KDF goals	Taks a source of initial keying material usually containg some good amount of randomness but whoch is not uniformly distributed or for which an attacker has some partial knowledge and derive from it one or more cryptographically strong secret keys
marlin	KDF in out	Cryptgraphically strong function which takes input which is statistically random but whose output is not uniformly distributed and then to use this secret as a symmetric key as a symmetric key you pass it through a KDF
marlin	DJKE	Diffie-Hellman with randomly selected keys produces a shared secret that is statistically random byt produces output which is not uniformly distributed so to use this secret as a symmetric key you pass it through a KDF
marlin	KDF base construction	input binary encoded secret or key or other info to derive a specific key or outpit size if configurable
marlin	KDF base construction	output a derived key or derived keying materia
marlin	KDF base construction	possible different parameters salt work factor memory usage parallelism
marlin	KDF base construction	output of programming interfaces could contain add config or input params such as attributes of the output key
marlin	KDF idea	The idea is that a KDF is one way and that the output is indistinguishable from random
marlin	hard input	It should be hard to brute force the input keying material if the input material contains a certain amount of randomness
marlin	KDF Building materials	Usually built from one way hashes or PRF such as MAC algos
marlin	KDF	KDFs should be deterministic therefore KDF itself is also a PRD
