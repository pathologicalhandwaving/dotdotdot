= Set custom icons in Mac OS X El Capitan
Matthew Petty @lodestone

Reset your custom icons for apps in El Capitan with this script. Especially useful for apps that update _too_ frequently. (I'm looking at you: Transmission and Calibre)


== Instructions:

. Put `reset-custom-icons` somewhere in your `$PATH`
. `chmod +x WHEREVER_YOU_PUT_THE_SCRIPT`
. Edit `.config/custom-icons.yaml` adding the app name and path of the icon on your computer.

All done!

Cheers!
