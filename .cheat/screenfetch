[4mOptions[0m:
   [1m-v[0m                 Verbose output.
   [1m-o 'OPTIONS'[0m       Allows for setting script variables on the
                      command line. Must be in the following format...
                      'OPTION1="OPTIONARG1";OPTION2="OPTIONARG2"'
   [1m-d '+var;-var;var'[0m Allows for setting what information is displayed
                      on the command line. You can add displays with +var,var. You
                      can delete displays with -var,var. Setting without + or - will
                      set display to that explicit combination. Add and delete statements
                      may be used in conjunction by placing a ; between them as so:
                      +var,var,var;-var,var.
   [1m-n[0m                 Do not display ASCII distribution logo.

   [1m-s [-u IMGHOST][0m    Using this flag tells the script that you want it
                      to take a screenshot. Use the -u flag if you would like
                      to upload the screenshots to one of the pre-configured
                      locations. These include: teknik, imgur, mediacrush and hmp.

                      ASCII logo colors and the label colors. The second argument
                      controls the colors of the information found. One argument may be

                      informations on the variables format.
