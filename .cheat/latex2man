usage: latex2man [-t transfile] [-c cssfile] [-HTML] [-C name] [-h] [-V] infile outfile.
  A tool to translate UNIX manual pages written with LaTeX into a format
  understood by the UNIX man(1)-command.
  Reads infile, writes outfile.

  -t transfile:  Translation for user defined LaTeX macros.
  -c CSSfile:    If -H is given, add a link to the \`CSSfile\' and use those
                 CSS definitions.
  -M:            Produce output suitable for the man(1) command (default).
  -H:            Instead of producing output suitable for the man(1) command,
                 HTML code is produced (despite of the name of the command).
  -T:            Instead of producing output suitable for the man(1) command,
		 TEXINFO code is produced (despite of the name of the command).
  -L:            Output the LaTeX source. Useful in conjunctin with the -C
                 option.
  -C name:       Enable conditional text \`name\'.
                 To enable more than one conditional name use quotes:
                 -C 'name1 name2 ...'
                 The following names are defined automatically:
		    -H defines  HTML
                    -T defines  TEXI
		    -M defines  MAN
		    -L defines  LATEX
  -a char:       Is used only in conjunction with -T.
	         Background:
		   TEXINFO ignores all blanks before the first word on a
                   new line. In order to produce some additional space before
	           that word (using \SP) some character has to be printed
		   before the additional space. By default this is a . (dot).
		 The 'char' specifies an alternative for that first character.
                 Giving a blank (-a" ") supresses the indentation of a line.
                 Note: only for the first \SP of a series that char is printed.
  -h:            Help.
  -V:            Version.
