Usage: catimg [-h] [-w width] [-l loops] [-r resolution] image-file

  -h: Displays this message
  -w: Terminal width by default
  -l: Loops are only useful with GIF files. A value of 1 means that the GIF will be displayed twice because it loops once. A negative value means infinite looping
  -r: Resolution must be 1 or 2. By default catimg checks for unicode support to use higher resolution
  -c: Convert colors to a restricted palette
