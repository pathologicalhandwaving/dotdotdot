[1mNAME[0m
    [1mtexdirflatten[0m - Collects all components of a (La)TeX file in a single
    output directory -- i.e., flattens its hierarchy.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
    texdirflatten [-1|--onetex] [-f|--file input.tex] [-o outputdir]
    [--imgexts .ext1,.ext2,...] [--debug] [-V|--version] [-?|--help]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
    This Perl script parses a LaTeX file recursively, scanning all child
    files, and collects details of any included and other data files, such as
    graphics and BiBTeX bibliography files. These component files, are then
    all put into a single directory (thus "flattening" the document's
    directory tree). This is useful in distributing manuscripts to
    collaborators or in submitting to journals.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
    [1m--file[0m, [1m-f[0m [4minput.tex[0m
        Specifies input (La)TeX file.

    [1m--onetex[0m, [1m-1[0m
        If specified, produces a single TeX file by expanding all \input and
        \include commands in place.

    [1m--output[0m, [1m-o[0m [4moutputdir[0m
        Directory to collect all files. [1mtexdirflatten[0m will copy each source
        file, graphics and bibliography file to this directory. It will be
        created if it is unexistent. If unspecified, it defaults to "flat/".

    [1m--imgexts[0m [4m.ext1,.ext2[,...][0m
        Prepends to the prioritized list of image extensions to search when
        trying to find the image to copy to output folder. The first file with
        the extension found will be copied and search stopped. Default order
        is "", ".eps", ".pdf", ".pstex" (note that it includes files with no
        extension). If using pdflatex, one may want to add PDF before EPS with
        "--imgexts .pdf". Don't forget the dot before the extension!

    [1m--debug[0m
        Enables copious amounts of debugging output - useful if something is
        going wrong.

    [1m--version[0m, [1m-V[0m
        Displays the current version number and the usage and exits.

    [1m--help[0m, [1m-?[0m
        Show this manual page.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
    The following example scans "manuscript.tex" in the current directory and
    gathers it and all its components in the "submit_01/" directory:

     $ texdirflatten -f manuscript.tex -o submit_01

[1mCAVEATS[0m
    Please take backups before running this command. No warranties whatsoever
    provided.

    You may need to run "epstopdf" on EPS files if you are using "pdflatex":

     $ for i in *.eps; do epstopdf $i; done

[1mBUGS[0m
